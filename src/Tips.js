                    <h2>Being In The Zone</h2>
                    <h3>By Holly Scholles</h3>
                    <p>It’s so sad to put a young and hopeful plant into the soil and then watch it flounder, or even die.  This happens if you select the wrong plant for our temperatures, or plant too soon.</p>
                    <p> April is still early in the growing season and, despite some sunny weather,  we have overnight frosts. So it is important to know the cold hardiness of the plants you are putting in the ground. If you decide to plant tender starts in April, like basil or tomatoes,  you will need to provide them with protection from the cold, especially at night.   Covering them with cloches or remay can work, or you can cut the bottom off of gallon milk jugs to cover your plants.  Be sure to leave the lids off of the jugs to allow air circulation.</p>
                    <p>One way to determine a plant’s tolerance to cold is to learn which USDA Zone the plant is rated for. The USDA divides the United States into zones based on average minimum temperatures. In the Beaverton area, we are rated <strong>Zone 8b</strong>, which means that to thrive here, plants must withstand minimum temperatures from 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
                    <p>To find your zone, go to  <a class='hyperlink' href="https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/">The USDA Agriculture Research Website</a> to enter your specific zip code at the <a href="https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx" class="hyperlink">USDA Hardiness map</a>.</p>
                    <p>  Conditions within growing zones are not the same, and it is important for gardeners to keep this in mind when selecting plants. Many factors, in addition to hardiness zones, contribute to the success or failure of plants. wind, soil type, soil moisture, humidity, amount of sun, pollution, snow, and winter sunshine can greatly affect the survival of plants. The way plants are placed in the landscape, how they are planted, and their size and health might also influence their survival.</p>
                    <p> And not all plant groups flourish in the same zone. For example, the hardiness zone for Red Leaved Banana trees <i>(Ensente ventricosum)</i> is 10 – 11. The lowest average temperature of <strong>Zone 11</strong> is 40 to 50 degrees (F). This banana would not survive the winter in Beaverton – way too cold!  If you want to plant a banana tree here, you should consider the genus <i>Musa</i>, cold hardy bananas rated to Zone 4.  <i>Musa</i> species can survive an average cold temperature of -10 to -20 degrees – the perfect banana plant if you live in the Alaskan interior!</p>
                    <p>Bottom line, a plant that is rated #1-7a is probably not going to survive the winter here unless you grow it as an annual, or over-winter it in a greenhouse or other protected area.  Choose wisely and stay in the zone!</p>

                    <h2>Where To Go When You Need To Know (And Plants)</h2>
                    <h3>By Holly Scholles</h3>
                    <p>I’ve been gardening for over 40 years, and still have SO MUCH to learn!  When I have gardening questions, I seek out even more experienced gardeners.  Here are my go-to people.</p>
                    <p>The nursery growers at our local Beaverton Farmer’s Market are full of helpful insights and advice. <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.beavertonfarmersmarket.com/">The  Beaverton Farmers Market Website</a>  The Market has an ever-changing list of growers, depending on the month and season.  They even have specialists, such as peonies or ferns!</p>
                    <p>My favorite local grower is <strong>Polly Gottesman</strong> from <strong>Pumpkin Ridge Gardens</strong>.  I’ve known Polly for over 20 years, when I was an early member of the Pumpkin Ridge CSA (Community Supported Agriculture).  Polly has a booth at the Beaverton Farmers’ Market, where she sells veggie starts beginning in April, as well as cut flowers and, later in the season, wreaths and other plant décor.    You can order organic plant starts from her by visiting her <a class="hyperlink" href="https://pumpkinridgegardens.square.site/">webstore</a> or you can browse her booth at the Market.  She is a gardening wise woman.</p>
                    <p><strong> <a class="hyperlink" href="https://farmingtongardens.com/">Farmington Gardens</a></strong> is a great place to visit for veggie starts, berries, and fruit trees, as well as non-edible plants, pots, bird baths, soil, fertilizer, and other garden needs, including solitary bee houses!   With three locations in the Beaverton area, you’re never far from what you need.  They are my go-to for organic, biodynamic compost and soil, and when I only want ONE or TWO plants (and I mean it this time), rather than the many, many plants that result when I start from seed.  They offer informative classes and a help-desk staffed with knowledgeable folks at the main location on Farmington Road.</p>

                    <p>Those are my go-to people for gardening questions.  Let me know who you go to for gardening advise, and we’ll add them to the list.</p>
